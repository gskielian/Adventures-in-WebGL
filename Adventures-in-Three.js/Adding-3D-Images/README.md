Adding 3D Images
================

In this tutorial, I'll demonstrate how to get a 3D object from online (say Google's 3D Warehouse) and add it to your Three.js scene.

### Get Three.js 

If you haven't already gotten Three.js, then clone with the following command 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```
